As a tech lead, Vanja's incredible work ethic, bias towards action, and technical expertise was evident immediately. From day 1 he quickly mastered a complex domain and was able to deliver results. Vanja leaves no stone unturned in ensuring that any gaps in requirements or unforeseen complexities are immediately brought to the teams attention. Vanja is also an excellent manager and effectively led a large, highly productive backend development team for our project.

I couldn't have asked for a better engineer to lead our project with as much knowledge, tenacity, and drive to see the product succeed and continually improve as we progressed from exploration to delivery of the product.
